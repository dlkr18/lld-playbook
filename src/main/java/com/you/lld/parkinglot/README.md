# Parking Lot System - Day 1: Requirements & Design

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Vehicle Entry/Exit**
   - System should allow different vehicle types (Car, Motorcycle, Truck, Bus)
   - Generate and validate parking tickets
   - Track entry and exit times

2. **Parking Space Management**
   - Multiple floors with different space types (Compact, Large, Motorcycle, Disabled)
   - Real-time availability tracking
   - Optimal space allocation based on vehicle type

3. **Payment Processing**
   - Multiple payment methods (Cash, Credit Card, Mobile Payment)
   - Dynamic pricing based on vehicle type and duration
   - Receipt generation

4. **Administrative Functions**
   - Add/remove parking floors and spaces
   - View occupancy reports
   - Configure pricing policies

### Business Rules
- **Space Allocation Priority**: 
  - Motorcycles: Motorcycle > Compact > Large
  - Cars: Compact > Large
  - Trucks/Buses: Large only
- **Payment**: Must be completed before exit
- **Lost Ticket**: Maximum daily rate charged
- **Disabled Spaces**: Reserved for vehicles with disabled permits

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### Performance
- **Entry/Exit Processing**: < 2 seconds per transaction
- **Availability Check**: < 500ms response time
- **Concurrent Operations**: Support 1000+ simultaneous vehicles

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Support multiple parking lots
- **Vertical Scaling**: Handle 10,000+ parking spaces per lot
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-location support

### Reliability
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Data Consistency**: No double-booking of spaces
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues with partial failures

### Security
- **Ticket Validation**: Prevent fraud with secure ticket generation
- **Payment Security**: PCI-DSS compliant payment processing
- **Access Control**: Role-based admin access

### Maintainability
- **Modular Design**: Pluggable pricing and payment strategies
- **Configuration**: Runtime configuration changes
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics

## Domain Model

### Core Entities
- **ParkingLot**: Top-level container with multiple floors
- **ParkingFloor**: Contains parking spaces of different types
- **ParkingSpace**: Individual space with type and availability
- **Vehicle**: Represents parked vehicle with type and license
- **ParkingTicket**: Entry proof with timestamp and space assignment
- **Payment**: Transaction record with amount and method
- **PricingStrategy**: Configurable pricing logic

### Value Objects
- **VehicleType**: MOTORCYCLE, CAR, TRUCK, BUS
- **SpaceType**: MOTORCYCLE, COMPACT, LARGE, DISABLED
- **PaymentMethod**: CASH, CREDIT_CARD, MOBILE_PAYMENT
- **PaymentStatus**: PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED

### Relationships
- ParkingLot (1) → (N) ParkingFloor
- ParkingFloor (1) → (N) ParkingSpace
- Vehicle (1) → (1) ParkingTicket
- ParkingTicket (1) → (1) ParkingSpace
- ParkingTicket (1) → (0..1) Payment

## API Design Principles

### Interface Segregation
- Separate interfaces for different concerns (entry, payment, admin)
- Client-specific interfaces rather than monolithic APIs

### Dependency Inversion
- Abstract pricing strategies
- Pluggable payment processors
- Configurable space allocation algorithms

### Single Responsibility
- Each service handles one aspect of parking management
- Clear separation between domain logic and infrastructure

### Error Handling
- Checked exceptions for business rule violations
- Runtime exceptions for system failures
- Comprehensive error codes and messages

## Next Steps (Day 2-5)
- Apply SOLID principles to refine design
- Implement design patterns (Strategy, Factory, Observer)
- Create UML diagrams
- Build value objects and domain entities
- Implement API contracts with comprehensive tests
