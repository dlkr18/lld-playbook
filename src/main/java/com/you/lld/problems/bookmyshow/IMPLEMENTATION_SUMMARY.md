---

### 3. **Implementation Layer**

#### A. Core Service
- **`EnhancedBookingService`**: Main booking service with:
  - Search & discovery (movies, shows, theaters)
  - Seat availability checking
  - Atomic booking creation
  - Transaction-like confirmation
  - Cancellation with seat release
  - Multi-channel notifications

#### B. Concurrency Control
- **`SeatLockManager`**: Advanced seat locking with:
  - **Per-seat fine-grained locks** (not show-level)
  - **Deadlock prevention** (sorted locking)
  - **Automatic expiry** (5-minute timeout)
  - **Atomic all-or-nothing** locking
  - **Rollback on failure**

#### C. Pricing Strategies
1. **`SimplePricingStrategy`**: Flat pricing by seat type
   - REGULAR: ₹120
   - PREMIUM: ₹200
   - VIP: ₹350

2. **`DynamicPricingStrategy`**: Time-based pricing
   - Base prices
   - Weekend premium (+30%)
   - Evening premium (+20%)
   - Surge pricing capability

#### D. Notification Strategies
1. **`EmailNotificationStrategy`**: Email notifications
2. **`SMSNotificationStrategy`**: SMS notifications
3. **`MultiChannelNotificationStrategy`**: Composite (sends to multiple channels)

## 🎨 Design Patterns Applied

| Pattern | Where Used | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Strategy** | PricingStrategy, NotificationStrategy | Pluggable algorithms |
| **Composite** | MultiChannelNotificationStrategy | Combine multiple strategies |
| **Dependency Injection** | EnhancedBookingService constructor | Loose coupling, testability |
| **Value Object** | Money, Seat | Immutability, domain modeling |
| **Builder** | Demo setup methods | Complex object construction |
| **Repository** | Service as in-memory repository | Data access abstraction |
| **Transaction Script** | confirmBooking() synchronized block | ACID-like guarantees |

---

## 🔒 Concurrency Features

### 1. Fine-Grained Locking
```
Traditional (Show-Level Lock):
  ❌ Only 1 user can book at a time for entire show
  ❌ Poor throughput

Our Approach (Seat-Level Lock):
  ✅ Multiple users book different seats concurrently
  ✅ High throughput
  ✅ Per-seat contention only
```

### 2. Deadlock Prevention
```java
// Sort seat IDs before locking
List<String> sortedSeatIds = new ArrayList<>(seatIds);
Collections.sort(sortedSeatIds);

// Always acquire locks in same order
// → No circular wait → No deadlocks
```

### 3. Thread Safety
- `ConcurrentHashMap` for all data stores
- `synchronized` blocks for atomic operations
- `ScheduledExecutorService` for cleanup
- `putIfAbsent()` for race condition handling

---

## 💰 Money Type Integration

Uses `Money` value object instead of `double`:

```java
// ❌ BAD: Floating-point errors
double price1 = 0.1 + 0.2; // 0.30000000000000004

// ✅ GOOD: Accurate currency handling
Money price1 = Money.of(new BigDecimal("0.10"), currency);
Money price2 = Money.of(new BigDecimal("0.20"), currency);
Money total = price1.plus(price2); // Exactly 0.30
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No rounding errors
- ✅ Currency-safe operations
- ✅ Immutable value object
- ✅ Type-safe (can't mix currencies)

---

## 📊 Demo Scenarios

The `BookMyShowDemo` showcases:

1. **Basic Booking Flow**
   - Lock seats → Create booking → Process payment → Confirm
   - Multi-channel notifications sent

2. **Concurrent Booking (Race Condition)**
   - 2 users try to book same seats simultaneously
   - Only 1 succeeds, other gets proper error

3. **Seat Lock Timeout**
   - User locks seats but doesn't complete booking
   - Seats auto-release after timeout
   - Other users can then book

4. **Booking Cancellation**
   - Cancel confirmed booking
   - Seats released immediately
   - Refund notification sent

5. **Search & Filter**
   - Search movies by title/language
   - Find shows by city
   - Check seat availability

6. **Dynamic Pricing**
   - Compare simple vs dynamic pricing
   - Show weekend/evening premiums
