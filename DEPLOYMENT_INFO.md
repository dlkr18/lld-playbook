## 🔄 How to Check if Live:

Look for:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Deployed successfully
- 🟡 Yellow dot = Deploying now
- ❌ Red X = Failed (unlikely)

### Method 2: Force Refresh Your Browser
1. Visit: https://dlkr18.github.io/lld-playbook/
2. **Hard Refresh**:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R` or `Cmd + Option + R`
3. Check if changes are visible

### Method 3: Use Incognito/Private Window

## 📊 What Changed (Should See):

### 1. Cleaner Sidebar ✨

### 2. All Clickable Links ✨

---

## 🚀 Quick Test:

Once live, test these:

1. **Sidebar**: Should look cleaner, no `---` separators
2. **Week 2 → Day 6**: Builder Pattern examples should be clickable links
3. **Any problem**: Click name → Opens guide with CODE link

---

## ⚡ If Not Updating:

### 1. Clear Browser Cache:
```
Settings → Privacy → Clear Browsing Data → Cached Images
```

### 2. Wait 2-3 Minutes:
- GitHub Pages CDN needs time to propagate
- Usually quick, but can take up to 5 minutes

### 3. Check Different Browser:
- If one browser shows old version
- Try Chrome/Firefox/Safari

---

## 📱 Mobile vs Desktop:

- **Desktop**: Usually updates faster
- **Mobile**: May cache more aggressively
- **Solution**: Use incognito mode on mobile
