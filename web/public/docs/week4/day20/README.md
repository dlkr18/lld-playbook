# Day 20: Mock Interviews — LLD Mastery 🎯

**Focus**: Practice whiteboard and coding-focused LLD interviews with realistic scenarios.

---

## 🎯 **Interview Format**

### **Typical Structure (45-60 min)**
1. **Clarification** (5-10 min): Gather requirements
2. **High-Level Design** (10-15 min): Core entities and relationships
3. **API Design** (10 min): Define interfaces and contracts
4. **Deep Dive** (15-20 min): Implement key components
5. **Discussion** (5-10 min): Trade-offs, scalability, extensions

## 📋 **Interview Checklist**

### **Before You Start:**
- [ ] Clarify functional requirements
- [ ] Ask about non-functional requirements (scale, latency)
- [ ] Identify core use cases
- [ ] Ask about constraints and limitations

### **During Design:**
- [ ] Think aloud — explain your reasoning
- [ ] Start with entities and relationships
- [ ] Define clean API contracts
- [ ] Consider edge cases
- [ ] Discuss trade-offs

### **Implementation:**
- [ ] Start with core classes
- [ ] Use meaningful names
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Write testable code

## 🎮 **Mock Interview #1: Parking Lot System**

### **Requirements Gathering**

**Ask:**
- How many floors and spots per floor?
- What vehicle types? (Motorcycle, Car, Truck)
- Multiple entrances/exits?
- Payment methods?
- Hourly vs flat rate pricing?

**NFRs:**
- Entry/exit time < 100ms
- Handle 1000 concurrent vehicles
- 99.9% uptime

### **Core Entities**
```
ParkingLot
├── List<Floor>
├── List<Entrance>
├── List<Exit>
└── PricingStrategy

Floor
├── int floorNumber
├── List<ParkingSpot>
└── Map<SpotType, available count>

ParkingSpot
├── String spotId
├── SpotType type
├── boolean isOccupied
└── Vehicle currentVehicle

Vehicle
├── String licensePlate
├── VehicleType type
└── Ticket ticket

Ticket
├── String ticketId
├── Instant entryTime
├── ParkingSpot spot
├── Vehicle vehicle
└── Money amountPaid
```

### **Key APIs**
```java
interface ParkingLotService {
    Ticket parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle);
    Money calculateFee(Ticket ticket);
    void processExit(Ticket ticket, Payment payment);
    int getAvailableSpots(VehicleType type);
}
```

### **Key Implementation Points**
- Spot allocation strategy (nearest entrance, floor preference)
- Concurrent spot reservation
- Pricing strategy pattern
- Payment processing

## 🎮 **Mock Interview #2: Elevator System**

### **Requirements Gathering**

**Ask:**
- How many elevators and floors?
- Maximum capacity per elevator?
- Peak hours traffic pattern?
- Maintenance mode support?

### **Core Design**

```
ElevatorSystem
├── List<Elevator>
├── Scheduler
└── RequestQueue

Elevator
├── int currentFloor
├── Direction direction
├── ElevatorState state
├── Set<Integer> destinationFloors
└── int capacity

Request
├── int floor
├── Direction direction
├── Instant requestTime

Scheduler (Interface)
├── FCFS
├── SCAN
└── LOOK
```

### **Scheduling Algorithms**

| Algorithm | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **FCFS** | First come, first served | Low traffic |
| **SCAN** | Move in one direction, then reverse | Balanced |
| **LOOK** | Like SCAN, but only to furthest request | Efficient |
| **Destination Dispatch** | Group by destination | High-rise |

## 🎮 **Mock Interview #3: Rate Limiter**

### **Requirements**
- Support multiple strategies (Token Bucket, Sliding Window)
- Per-user and per-API limits
- Distributed support
- Graceful degradation

### **Quick Design**
```java
interface RateLimiter {
    boolean tryAcquire(String clientId);
    RateLimitInfo getInfo(String clientId);
}

class RateLimitInfo {
    int limit;
    int remaining;
    Instant resetTime;
}
```

### **Discussion Points**
- Algorithm trade-offs
- Distributed consistency
- HTTP response headers
- Burst handling

---

## 🎮 **Mock Interview #4: URL Shortener**

### **Requirements**
- Shorten URLs
- Redirect to original
- Analytics (click count, location)
- Custom aliases (optional)
- Expiration (optional)

### **Key Decisions**
- ID generation (Base62 encoding)
- Storage (key-value store)
- Caching strategy
- Collision handling

### **API Design**
```java
interface UrlShortenerService {
    ShortenedUrl shorten(String originalUrl, ShortenOptions options);
    String resolve(String shortCode);
    UrlStats getStats(String shortCode);
}
```

---

## 🎮 **Mock Interview #5: Library Management**

### **Entities**
- Book, Member, Librarian
- BookCopy, Reservation, Fine
- Catalog, Search

### **Key Features**
- Search by title, author, ISBN
- Reserve books
- Checkout/return with due dates
- Fine calculation
- Multiple copies of same book

---

## 📝 **Interview Tips**

### **Communication**
1. **Think aloud**: Explain your reasoning
2. **Ask questions**: Clarify before designing
3. **Be structured**: Follow a consistent approach
4. **Accept feedback**: Incorporate suggestions

### **Common Mistakes**
- ❌ Jumping to implementation too fast
- ❌ Not clarifying requirements
- ❌ Over-engineering simple problems
- ❌ Ignoring edge cases
- ❌ Not explaining trade-offs

### **What Interviewers Look For**
- ✅ Structured thinking
