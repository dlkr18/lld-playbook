# ✅ Day 6 & Day 7 - Fully Fixed and Consistent!

## 🎯 Issues Identified & Fixed:

### 1. **Day 6 vs Day 7 Inconsistency** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Day 6 had links to separate CODE.md, Day 7 had embedded examples  
**Solution:** Embedded examples in Day 6 README (User.java, PaymentProcessorFactory.java, GameCharacter.java)

### 2. **Day 7 Broken CODE.md Link** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem:** https://dlkr18.github.io/lld-playbook/#/week2/day7/CODE showed "Loading..."  
**Reason:** Day 7 has no CODE.md file (all examples are in README)  
**Solution:** Removed the broken link, added clear explanation that examples are embedded

## 📊 Current State:

| Day | CODE.md Exists? | Examples Location | Link Status |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Day 6 | ✅ Yes | Embedded + Link to full CODE.md | ✅ Working |
