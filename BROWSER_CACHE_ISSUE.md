## 🚀 How to See the Fixed Version:

### Method 1: Hard Refresh (Best!)
**Mac:**
- `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Or `Cmd + Option + R`

**Windows/Linux:**
- `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Or `Ctrl + F5`

### Method 2: Clear Cache
1. Open DevTools (`F12` or `Cmd+Option+I`)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Method 3: Incognito/Private Window
- Opens without any cache
- Shows the latest version immediately
- `Cmd + Shift + N` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Windows)

### Method 4: Wait for CDN
- GitHub Pages CDN caches for a while
- Should auto-refresh within 5-10 minutes
- But hard refresh is faster!

## 🎯 Quick Test After Hard Refresh:

1. Visit: https://dlkr18.github.io/lld-playbook/#/foundations/DESIGN_PATTERNS_CATALOG
2. Scroll to "Code Examples Location" section
3. Should see:
   - ✅ Clickable links
   - ✅ No "src/main/java/..." paths
   - ✅ No "(view in IDE)" text

---

## 💡 Why This Happens:

**Browser Caching:**
- Browsers cache markdown files
- Docsify caches content for speed
- GitHub Pages CDN also caches
- Result: Old content shows until cache cleared

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh = Forces new content
- Incognito = No cache at all
- Wait = Cache expires naturally

---

## ✅ Confirmation:

**To Verify It's Fixed:**
1. Open incognito window
2. Visit: https://dlkr18.github.io/lld-playbook/#/foundations/DESIGN_PATTERNS_CATALOG
3. Check "Code Examples Location" section
4. Should see clickable links! ✅

**Status:** ✅ Already Fixed in Repository  
**Issue:** Browser cache showing old version  
**Solution:** Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
