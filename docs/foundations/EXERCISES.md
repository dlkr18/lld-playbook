- List 2 business rules

**Step 2: NFRs (3 minutes)**
- Define performance targets
- Define scalability goals

**Step 3: Domain (5 minutes)**
- Identify 3 entities
- Identify 2 value objects
- Define 2 key relationships

**Step 4: Diagrams (conceptual)**
- What diagrams would you create?
- What would each diagram show?

**Step 5: APIs (5 minutes)**
- Suggest 2 main interfaces
- List key methods for each

## ‚úÖ **Self-Check Questions**

After completing the exercises, ask yourself:

1. **Requirements**: Can I distinguish between functional requirements and business rules?
2. **NFRs**: Do I understand the difference between performance and scalability?
3. **Domain**: Can I identify what should be an entity vs. value object?
4. **Diagrams**: Do I know when to use each type of UML diagram?
5. **APIs**: Can I think in terms of interfaces and contracts?

## üîÑ **Next Steps**

- Review your answers with the concepts from DAY1_LLD_PROCESS.md
- Practice this process on simple, familiar systems (library, bank, restaurant)
- Get comfortable with the terminology before moving to Day 2

**Remember**: The goal is to internalize the **systematic thinking process**, not to get perfect answers!
