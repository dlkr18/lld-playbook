## 🏆 **Interview Preparation Themes**

### **Problem Decomposition**
- Break complex problems into manageable parts
- Identify core entities and relationships
- Define clear API contracts

### **Trade-off Analysis**
- Performance vs. Readability
- Flexibility vs. Simplicity
- Consistency vs. Availability

### **Communication**
- Think aloud while designing
- Justify decisions with reasoning
- Accept and incorporate feedback
