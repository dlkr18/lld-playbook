## 📝 **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**

### **ADR Template**

```markdown
# ADR-001: [Title]

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated?
```

### **Example ADRs to Write**

1. **Database Choice**: SQL vs NoSQL
2. **Caching Strategy**: When and what to cache
3. **Authentication**: Session vs Token-based
4. **API Design**: REST vs GraphQL
5. **Error Handling**: Exception strategy
