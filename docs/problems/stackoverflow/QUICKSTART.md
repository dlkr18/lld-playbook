## 💡 Usage Examples

### Creating a User
```java
User alice = new User(
    new UserId(1),
    "alice_dev",           // Username: 3-20 chars, alphanumeric + underscore
    "alice@example.com",   // Valid email
    "hashed_password_123"  // Password hash
);
```

### Posting a Question
```java
Set<Tag> tags = new HashSet<>();
tags.add(new Tag("java"));
tags.add(new Tag("concurrency"));

Question question = new Question(
    new QuestionId(1),
    "How to implement thread-safe cache in Java?",  // 15-150 chars
    "I need to implement a cache that can be safely accessed...",  // Min 30 chars
    alice.getId(),
    tags  // 1-5 tags required
);
```

### Posting an Answer
```java
Answer answer = new Answer(
    new AnswerId(1),
    questionId,
    "For thread-safe caching, I recommend using ConcurrentHashMap...",  // Min 30 chars
    expertUserId
);
```

### Voting
```java
// Upvote
question.applyVote(VoteType.UPVOTE.getValue());  // +1 to vote count
user.addReputation(VoteType.UPVOTE.getReputationChange());  // +10 to reputation

// Downvote
answer.applyVote(VoteType.DOWNVOTE.getValue());  // -1 to vote count
user.addReputation(VoteType.DOWNVOTE.getReputationChange());  // -2 to reputation
```

### Accepting Answer
```java
// Question author accepts answer
question.acceptAnswer(answerId);
answer.markAsAccepted();
answerAuthor.addReputation(15);  // Acceptance bonus
```

## 🎯 Design Highlights

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Aggregates**: User, Question (contains Answers)
- **Entities**: User, Question, Answer
- **Value Objects**: UserId, QuestionId, AnswerId, Tag
- **Enums**: UserStatus, QuestionStatus, VoteType

### Business Rules Enforced

1. **User**
   - Username: 3-20 chars, alphanumeric + underscore
   - Email: Valid format, unique
   - Reputation: Starts at 1, cannot go below 0

2. **Question**
   - Title: 15-150 characters
   - Body: Minimum 30 characters
   - Tags: 1-5 tags required
   - Cannot edit/delete if has accepted answer

3. **Answer**
   - Body: Minimum 30 characters
   - Only one accepted answer per question
   - Cannot accept own answer

4. **Voting**
   - Upvote: +1 vote, +10 reputation
   - Downvote: -1 vote, -2 reputation
   - Cannot vote on own content

### Validation Examples
```java
// ❌ These throw IllegalArgumentException:
new User(id, "ab", email, hash);  // Username too short
new Question(id, "Short", body, author, tags);  // Title too short
new Answer(id, qid, "Too short", author);  // Body too short
new Tag("Invalid Tag!");  // Invalid characters

// ✅ These are valid:
new User(id, "alice_dev", email, hash);
new Question(id, "How to use Java streams?", body, author, tags);
new Answer(id, qid, "You can use streams like this: ...", author);
new Tag("java-8");
```

## 📊 Reputation Calculation

| Question receives downvote | -2 |
| Answer receives upvote | +10 |
| Answer receives downvote | -2 |
| Answer is accepted | +15 |
| Accept an answer (asker) | +2 (not implemented in demo) |

## 🎓 What You'll Learn

By studying this implementation:

1. **Domain-Driven Design**
   - Aggregate design and boundaries
   - Entity vs Value Object distinction
   - Rich domain models with behavior

2. **Business Rule Enforcement**
   - Validation in constructors
   - Invariant protection
   - State machine patterns

3. **Type Safety**
   - Type-safe identifiers prevent ID mixing
   - Enum for constrained values
   - Immutable value objects

4. **Reputation System**
   - Event-driven reputation changes
   - Reputation floor enforcement
   - Different actions, different rewards

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Study the Code**: Read through entity implementations
2. **Extend It**: Add Comment, Badge, or Vote tracking entities
3. **Add Services**: Implement QuestionService, AnswerService
4. **Add Persistence**: Create repository interfaces
5. **Add Tests**: Unit test all business rules
