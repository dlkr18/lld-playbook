## 🎯 **Quick Reference**

### **SOLID Acronym**
- **S**ingle Responsibility
- **O**pen/Closed  
- **L**iskov Substitution
- **I**nterface Segregation
- **D**ependency Inversion

### **GRASP Key Questions**
- **Information Expert**: Who has the data?
- **Creator**: Who should create this?
- **Controller**: Who handles system events?
- **Low Coupling**: How to minimize dependencies?
- **High Cohesion**: Do these belong together?

### **Design Quality Goals**
- ✅ **High Cohesion** - Related things together
- ✅ **Low Coupling** - Minimal dependencies
- ✅ **Single Responsibility** - One job per class
- ✅ **Open for Extension** - Easy to add features
- ✅ **Testable** - Easy to unit test
