## **Day 1 Learning Path**

```
1. LLD Process Overview
   ↓
2. Requirements Analysis (Functional & Non-Functional)
   ↓
3. Domain Modeling (Entities, Value Objects, Relationships)
   ↓
4. UML Diagrams (Class, Sequence, State)
   ↓
5. API Design (Clean interfaces)
   ↓
6. Hands-on Exercises (ATM & Food Delivery)
```

## **The LLD Process**

### **Step-by-Step Methodology**
```
Requirements Gathering
         ↓
Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
         ↓
Domain Modeling
         ↓
UML Diagrams
         ↓
API Design
         ↓
Implementation Planning
```

### **Key Deliverables**
- **Requirements Document** - What the system should do
- **NFRs Specification** - Performance, scalability, reliability goals
- **Domain Model** - Core entities and relationships
- **UML Diagrams** - Visual system design
- **API Contracts** - Clean interfaces and contracts

---

## **Quick Reference**

### **Requirements Types**
- **Functional**: What the system does
- **Non-Functional**: How well the system performs

### **Domain Concepts**
- **Entity**: Has identity, mutable (User, Order)
- **Value Object**: No identity, immutable (Money, Address)
- **Aggregate**: Consistency boundary
- **Repository**: Data access abstraction

### **UML Diagram Types**
- **Class**: Object structure and relationships
- **Sequence**: Process flow over time
- **State**: Object lifecycle and transitions
- **Component**: System architecture

### **Relationship Types**
- **Association**: "Uses-a" (loose coupling)
- **Aggregation**: "Has-a" (weak ownership)
- **Composition**: "Part-of" (strong ownership)
