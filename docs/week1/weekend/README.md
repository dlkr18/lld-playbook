# Weekend 1: Parking Lot System

**Project**: Build a complete Parking Lot management system with multiple pricing policies and extensibility.

---

## **Project Goals**

- Apply Week 1 concepts: OO modeling, UML diagrams, value objects
- Implement a complete, working system
- Practice extensible design with pricing strategies
- Handle concurrency for spot allocation

---

## **Requirements**

### **Functional**
1. Multiple floors with different spot types (Motorcycle, Compact, Regular, Large)
2. Entry/exit points with ticket generation
3. Multiple pricing strategies (Hourly, Daily, Weekly)
4. Real-time availability tracking
5. Payment processing

### **Non-Functional**
- Thread-safe spot allocation
- Entry/exit processing < 100ms
- Support 10,000+ spots

        -Vehicle vehicle
        -ParkingSpot spot

        -Instant exitTime
    }

    class PricingStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +calculateFee(Ticket): Money
    }

    class HourlyPricing {
        -Map~VehicleType, Money~ hourlyRates
        +calculateFee(Ticket): Money
    }

    Floor --> ParkingSpot
    ParkingSpot --> Vehicle
    ParkingLot --> PricingStrategy
    PricingStrategy <|.. HourlyPricing

## **Implementation Guide**

### **Step 1: Core Models** (30 min)
- Create `Vehicle`, `VehicleType`, `SpotType` enums
- Implement `ParkingSpot` with thread-safe operations
- Build `Floor` with spot management

### **Step 2: Ticket & Payment** (30 min)
- Implement `Ticket` as immutable value object
- Create `Payment` and `Receipt` models
- Add `Money` value object for pricing

### **Step 3: Pricing Strategies** (30 min)
- Define `PricingStrategy` interface
- Implement `HourlyPricing`
- Add `DailyPricing` and `WeekendPricing`

### **Step 4: ParkingLot Service** (45 min)
- Implement spot allocation algorithm
- Add concurrent entry/exit handling
- Create occupancy reporting

### **Step 5: Testing** (30 min)
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for full flow
- Concurrency tests

## **Acceptance Criteria**

- [] Park a motorcycle in compact/motorcycle spot
- [] Park a car in regular/large spot
- [] Calculate hourly fees correctly
- [] Handle concurrent parking requests
- [] Generate valid tickets with unique IDs
- [] Process payments and generate receipts
- [] Report real-time availability
